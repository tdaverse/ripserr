# ripserr 0.2.0

## Changes

* `vietoris_rips` and `cubical` are now S3 generics
* `vietoris_rips` accepts objects of class `data.frame`, `matrix`, `numeric`, `ts`, and `dist`
* `cubical` accepts objects of class `array` and `matrix` (for r-oldrel, in which not all `matrix` objects are also of class `array`)
* `vietoris_rips` and `cubical` return objects of class `PHom` and `data.frame` (instead of either `data.frame` or `matrix` previously)

# ripserr 0.1.1

## Logistics

* Added Code of Conduct (CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) from Contributor Covenant
* Added Contribution Guide (CONTRIBUTING.md) from ggalluvial
* Removed empty vignette (`cubical`), will add in next minor update (likely 0.2.x)

## Bugs

* Fixed memory leak in Cubical Ripser C++ code
* Fixed citation issue in vignette (`vietoris-rips`)
* Removed TDAstats from Suggests to avoid circular dependency in the future
* Fixed issue in old R versions where 2-d matrices are not automatically also of type "array" (cubical() checks)

* Ports Ripser for Vietoris-Rips complex functionality
* Ports Cubical Ripser for cubical complex functionality
